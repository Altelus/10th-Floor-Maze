pminx,pmax,pimy,pmaxy,pminz,pmaxz = the amount of movement with relation to a single tiles size
	for example, if you want to move a trap along the x-axis from current origin of the trap
	to the left of current tile and right of the current tile back and forth, then would do:

e.g. creates a star projectile with dimensions of 10% of the tile in all directions, and moving
to the left edge and right edge of the tile (with only rotation in y axis and moving at the
speed defined by default) with health loss of 30% upon collision with player
